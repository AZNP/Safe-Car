# Safe-Car
Hackathon Project
This project is to alert the owner/user that the designated room they may want to enter or in currently is too hot where it may sound 
an alarm for their personal safty to warn them that the room maybe to hot or in danger of the heat. For future purposes we want to apply
this to an remote automated car so with the product of respberry pie, you may have the ability to use your phone through bluetooth/wifi 
to check if the car is too hot to enter or not.
